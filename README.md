# CAN-Bus-Teensy-Testing
Testing CAN Bus on Teensy 3.2 and 3.6

CAN Bus Transmit and Receive code I ran between Teensy 3.2 and 3.6

I used this library: https://github.com/tonton81/IFCT

I used CAN Bus transceivers from eBay "SN65HVD230 CAN BusBoard Network Transceiver Module compatible with PCA82C250" - link at the time of writing: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/SN65HVD230-CAN-BusBoard-Network-Transceiver-Module-compatible-with-PCA82C250/201694556189

Note that there are three Tx sketches which all use different addresses, and one Rx to receive all three bits of data.
